I'm **[Aswin](https://github.com/Jarvis-Ank)**.\n","I created this project to make it easier for people with less skills to build their own version of ReVanced from already prepared libraries.\n","If you like my work, visit my profile and project page and leave a ‚≠ê and a follow.\n","* My GitHub: https://github.com/Jarvis-Ank\n","* Project URL: https://github.com/Jarvis-Ank/Re-Vanced\n","\n","---\n","\n","## What is YOUTUBE_ID?\n","**YOUTUBE_ID** is the identifier of the file you get after uploading the file to **Google Drive** and sharing it. It is required to create your version of the ReVanced client.\n","## How to get YOUTUBE_ID?\n","To get the ID you need, please follow the steps below:\n","1. Download the Youtube apk file from [ApkMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/uploads/?appcategory=youtube)\n","2. Upload the downloaded file to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)\n","3. Rename the file to \"***youtube.apk***\"\n","4. Share the file via the \"***Get link***\" option\n","5. Change the file accessibility to \"***Anyone with the link***\"\n","6. Now you just need to copy the generated link and paste it as YOUTUBE_ID\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RB5M0wvF_WBw"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uL5y1-3ES7wT"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title **Set variables** { vertical-output: true, display-mode: \"form\" }\n","YOUTUBE_ID = \"\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","INTEGRATIONS_TAG = \"latest\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","PATCHES_TAG = \"latest\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","CLI_TAG = \"latest\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","MICROG_URL = \"default\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","\n","from subprocess import run\n","import requests\n","def exec(cmd,show_output=False):\n","  if show_output:\n","    run(cmd, shell=True, check=True)\n","  else:\n","    out = run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)\n","\n","def get_tag(repo):\n","  return requests.get(f'https://api.github.com/repos/revanced/{repo}/releases/latest').json()['name'][1:]\n","\n","def check_tag(repo, tag):\n","  tags = []\n","  for v_tag in requests.get(f'https://api.github.com/repos/revanced/{repo}/tags').json(): tags.append(v_tag['name'])\n","  if tag in tags: return True\n","  else:\n","    print(f'Tag {tag} does\\'t exist in the revanced/{repo} repository.\\nUsing latest version.')\n","    return False\n","\n","def check_yt(url):\n","  if 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/' not in url:\n","    url = f'https://drive.google.com/file/d/{url}/view?usp=sharing'\n","  res = requests.get(url)\n","  if res.status_code == 200: return True\n","  else: return False\n","\n","# Updating system\n","print('Updating system before continuing')\n","exec('apt update')\n","exec('apt upgrade')\n","print('Update finished')\n","\n","# Removing old revanced.apk\n","exec('rm -f ./revanced.apk')\n","\n","# Creating working directory\n","print('Creating Directories....')\n","exec('mkdir ./R_V')\n","%cd R_V\n","exec('sleep 1')\n","\n","# Installing requirements\n","print('Installing gdown & Zulu JDK-17')\n","#Drive downloader\n","exec('pip install gdown')\n","exec('sleep 3')\n","#Zulu JDK-17 download and install\n","exec('wget -q --show-progress -O zulu-jdk17.deb https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.34.19-ca-jdk17.0.3-linux_amd64.deb')\n","exec('sleep 3')\n","exec('sudo apt install ./zulu-jdk17.deb')\n","print('Finished installing')\n","exec('sleep 5')\n","\n","# Downloading Required files\n","print('Downloading necessary files')\n","#Integrations\n","if INTEGRATIONS_TAG is 'latest' or not check_tag('revanced-integrations', INTEGRATIONS_TAG): INTEGRATIONS_TAG = get_tag('revanced-integrations')\n","exec(f'wget -q --show-progress -O revanced-integrations.apk https://github.com/revanced/revanced-integrations/releases/download/v{INTEGRATIONS_TAG}/app-release-unsigned.apk', True)\n","#Patches\n","if PATCHES_TAG is 'latest' or not check_tag('revanced-patches', PATCHES_TAG): PATCHES_TAG = get_tag('revanced-patches')\n","exec(f'wget -q --show-progress -O revanced-patches.jar https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases/download/v{PATCHES_TAG}/revanced-patches-{PATCHES_TAG}.jar', True)\n","#CLI\n","if CLI_TAG is 'latest' or not check_tag('revanced-cli', CLI_TAG): CLI_TAG = get_tag('revanced-cli')\n","exec(f'wget -q --show-progress -O revanced-cli.jar https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli/releases/download/v{CLI_TAG}/revanced-cli-{CLI_TAG}-all.jar', True)\n","#Micro-G\n","if MICROG_URL is 'default': MICROG_URL = 'https://github.com/Jarvis-Ank/Re-Vanced/blob/main/microG_0.2.24.220220.apk'\n","exec(f'wget -q --show-progress -O microg.apk {MICROG_URL}', True)\n","print('Download finished')\n","#Youtube\n","print('Downloading youtube apk')\n","retries = 0\n","while retries < 5:\n","  try:\n","    if not check_yt(YOUTUBE_ID): raise Exception('Incorrect Drive ID')\n","  except:\n","    print('Google Drive ID is missing or incorrect.\\nPlease provide correct id or url: ', end='')\n","    YOUTUBE_ID = input()\n","    retries += 1\n","    continue\n","  else:\n","    exec(f'gdown {YOUTUBE_ID}')\n","    break\n","print('Download finished')\n","exec('sleep 5')\n","\n","\n","# Building revanced.apk\n","print('Building revanced apk')\n","exec('java -jar revanced-cli.jar -a youtube.apk -c -o revanced.apk -b revanced-patches.jar -m revanced-integrations.apk')\n","print('Ended sucessfully')\n","exec('sleep 3')\n","\n","print('Moving output file')\n","%mv revanced.apk ..\n","print('Moved sucessfully')\n","exec('sleep 3')\n","\n","# Cleaning after build\n","%cd ..\n","print('Removing unnecessary files')\n","%rm -rf R_V\n","print('Removed sucessfully')\n","exec('sleep 3')\n","\n","# Finishing script\n","%pwd\n","print('Finished sucessfully, check if revanced.apk is in the folder')"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"Re-Vanced Compiler","provenance":[],"private_outputs":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"gpuClass":"standard"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
