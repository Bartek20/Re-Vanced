<hr>

You could manually provide compilation commands.
 but by default it uses non-root method from official [docs](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-documentation/wiki/Using-the-ReVanced-CLI-and-installing-ReVanced)
with `-d device-name` omitted.
``` # Non-Root
java -jar revanced-cli-all.jar -a some.apk -c -d device-name -o revanced.apk -b revanced-patches.jar 
```
